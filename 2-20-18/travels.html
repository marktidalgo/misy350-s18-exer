  <h1>My Travels</h1>
  <p>I have been lucky enough to travel all over the world with my family. Within the country, I have been to countless states from coast to coast. Outside of the U.S. I have been to Canada and Mexico. And outside of North America I have been to numerous
    places in Europe, Africa, and Asia.</p>
